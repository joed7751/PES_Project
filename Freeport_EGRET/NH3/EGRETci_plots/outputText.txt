 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1980  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1980 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 50  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is  -0.165  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is           -2.746  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.165 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.2627  -0.1111
 also 95% CIs  -0.2810  -0.0938 
 and 50% CIs  -0.2008  -0.1559
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc     0.039
* Note p-value should be considered to be < stated value
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0098  is trending down =       0.99

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is   -2.746 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs    -4.19    -2.16
 also 95% CIs    -4.74    -1.78 
 and 50% CIs    -3.26    -2.64
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux     0.039
* Note p-value should be considered to be < stated value
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.0098  is trending down= 0.99
