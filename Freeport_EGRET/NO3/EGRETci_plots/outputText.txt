  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1975  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1975 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 50  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is  0.0167  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is           0.4762  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is  0.0167 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.01529  0.06976
 also 95% CIs -0.06313  0.08462 
 and 50% CIs  0.00401  0.03005
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.41
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =      0.794  is trending down =      0.206

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is   0.4762 10^6 kg/year
