 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1971  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1971 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 50  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is -0.0925  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is           -1.544  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.0925 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.1142  -0.0724
 also 95% CIs  -0.1154  -0.0680 
 and 50% CIs  -0.1018  -0.0840
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc     0.039
* Note p-value should be considered to be < stated value
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0098  is trending down =       0.99

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is   -1.544 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs   -2.129   -1.012
 also 95% CIs   -2.165   -0.787 
 and 50% CIs   -1.806   -1.334
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux     0.039
* Note p-value should be considered to be < stated value
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.0098  is trending down= 0.99

 Upward trend in concentration is highly unlikely 
 Upward trend in flux is highly unlikely
