 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1974  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1973 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 50  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is  -0.264  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is           -4.079  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.264 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.3979   0.0295
 also 95% CIs  -0.4115   0.1041 
 and 50% CIs  -0.3427  -0.2106
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.12
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0572  is trending down =      0.943

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is   -4.079 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs   -6.521   -0.121
 also 95% CIs   -6.796    0.642 
 and 50% CIs   -5.275   -3.224
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux      0.08
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.0423  is trending down= 0.958

 Upward trend in concentration is very unlikely 
 Upward trend in flux is highly unlikely
 Downward trend in concentration is very likely 
 Downward trend in flux is highly likely
