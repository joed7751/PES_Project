 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1975  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1975 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is -0.00832  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is         -0.04584  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.00832 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.02109  0.01685
 also 95% CIs -0.02741  0.03285 
 and 50% CIs -0.01233  0.00241
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.64
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =      0.322  is trending down =      0.678

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.04584 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.15708  0.06560
