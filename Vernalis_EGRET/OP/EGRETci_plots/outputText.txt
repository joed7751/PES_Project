  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year 1991 to Water Year 2011
                   data set runs from Water Year 1990 to Water Year 2011
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is 0.000817  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is         -2.708e-06  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is 0.000817 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.000765  0.002487
 also 95% CIs -0.001026  0.002984 
 and 50% CIs  0.000278  0.001452
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.35
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =      0.827  is trending down =      0.173

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is -2.708e-06 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -3.98e-05  3.22e-05
 also 95% CIs -6.82e-05  3.35e-05 
 and 50% CIs -1.70e-05  1.69e-05
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux      0.96
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.52  is trending down= 0.48

 Upward trend in concentration is likely 
 Upward trend in flux is about as likely as not
 Downward trend in concentration is unlikely 
 Downward trend in flux is about as likely as not
