 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year 1991 to Water Year 2011
                   data set runs from Water Year 1990 to Water Year 2011
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is -0.00736  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is         -0.0001151  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.00736 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.01041 -0.00282
 also 95% CIs -0.01124 -0.00248 
 and 50% CIs -0.00833 -0.00485
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.02
* Note p-value should be considered to be < stated value
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =    0.00495  is trending down =      0.995

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.0001151 10^6 kg/year
