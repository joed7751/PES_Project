 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1972  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1971 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is  -0.144  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is          -0.2664  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.144 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.2937   0.0941
 also 95% CIs  -0.3179   0.1171 
 and 50% CIs  -0.1762  -0.0296
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.35
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =      0.173  is trending down =      0.827

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.2664 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.5688   0.1880
 also 95% CIs  -0.6807   0.2887 
 and 50% CIs  -0.3710  -0.0197
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux      0.47
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.233  is trending down= 0.767
