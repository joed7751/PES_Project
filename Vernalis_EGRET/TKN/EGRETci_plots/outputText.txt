 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year 1991 to Water Year 2011
                   data set runs from Water Year 1990 to Water Year 2011
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is -0.0654  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is         -0.003084  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.0654 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.0959  -0.0316
 also 95% CIs  -0.1081   0.7874 
 and 50% CIs  -0.0834  -0.0532
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc     0.059
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0248  is trending down =      0.975

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.003084 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.006083  0.005618
 also 95% CIs -0.013042  0.485416 
 and 50% CIs -0.004486 -0.002421
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux      0.16
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.0842  is trending down= 0.916

 Upward trend in concentration is highly unlikely 
 Upward trend in flux is very unlikely
 Downward trend in concentration is highly likely 
 Downward trend in flux is very likely
