 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1974  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1973 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is  -0.782  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is           -2.856  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.782 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs   -1.042   -0.284
 also 95% CIs   -1.050   -0.209 
 and 50% CIs   -0.936   -0.521
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc     0.027
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0149  is trending down =      0.985

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is   -2.856 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -4.7856   1.3324
 also 95% CIs  -4.8654   2.5718 
 and 50% CIs  -4.0946  -1.6159
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux      0.21
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.104  is trending down= 0.896

 Upward trend in concentration is highly unlikely 
 Upward trend in flux is unlikely
 Downward trend in concentration is highly likely 
 Downward trend in flux is likely
