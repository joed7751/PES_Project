 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1975  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1975 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is  -0.114  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is          -0.2563  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.114 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.1419  -0.0469
 also 95% CIs  -0.1494  -0.0112 
 and 50% CIs  -0.1204  -0.0956
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc     0.035
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0149  is trending down =      0.985

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.2563 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.3808  -0.0513
 also 95% CIs  -0.4102  -0.0167 
 and 50% CIs  -0.3129  -0.1995
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux     0.038
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.0149  is trending down= 0.985
