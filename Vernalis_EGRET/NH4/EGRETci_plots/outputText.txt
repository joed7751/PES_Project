  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year 1991 to Water Year 2011
                   data set runs from Water Year 1990 to Water Year 2011
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is 0.000771  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is         2.414e-05  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is 0.000771 mg/L

 also 95% CIs -0.004983  0.001718 
 and 50% CIs  0.000283  0.001008
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.28
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =      0.856  is trending down =      0.144
