 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1972  to Water Year  2018
                   data set runs from Water Year 1972 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is -0.0861  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is          -0.1641  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.0861 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs  -0.1208  -0.0419
 also 95% CIs  -0.1261  -0.0298 
 and 50% CIs  -0.1000  -0.0707
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.02
* Note p-value should be considered to be < stated value
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =    0.00495  is trending down =      0.995

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.1641 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.39129 -0.00944
 also 95% CIs -0.49413  0.02155 
 and 50% CIs -0.26123 -0.10088
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux     0.059
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.0248  is trending down= 0.975

 Upward trend in concentration is highly unlikely 
 Upward trend in flux is highly unlikely
