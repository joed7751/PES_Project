 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year 1991 to Water Year 2011
                   data set runs from Water Year 1990 to Water Year 2011
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is -0.00392  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is         -0.0003109  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.00392 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -0.010593 -0.000426
 also 95% CIs -0.012237  0.001596 
 and 50% CIs -0.006782 -0.002892
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc     0.074
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0324  is trending down =      0.968

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is -0.0003109 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs -8.64e-04  1.02e-04
