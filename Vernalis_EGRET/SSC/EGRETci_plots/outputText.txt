  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year 1991 to Water Year 2011
                   data set runs from Water Year 1991 to Water Year 2011
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is   -3.77  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is          -0.4692  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is   -3.77 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs    -9.81    85.81
 also 95% CIs   -35.60  1593.68 
 and 50% CIs    -5.90    -2.51
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.17
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =     0.0842  is trending down =      0.916

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is  -0.4692 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs   -2.916   48.136

 and 50% CIs   -0.915   -0.314
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux      0.22
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.114  is trending down= 0.886

 Upward trend in concentration is very unlikely 
 Upward trend in flux is unlikely
