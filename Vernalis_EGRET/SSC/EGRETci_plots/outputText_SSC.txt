 Water Year

  Bootstrap process, for change from Water Year  1987  to Water Year  2017
                   data set runs from Water Year 1986 to Water Year 2019
  Bootstrap block length in days 200
  bootBreak is 100  confStop is 0.7

 WRTDS estimated concentration change is   -15.1  mg/L
 WRTDS estimated flux change is           -60.16  10^6 kg/yr

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Concentration Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is   -15.1 mg/L
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs   -36.34     6.22
 also 95% CIs   -41.80    17.68 
 and 50% CIs   -21.76    -6.92
 approximate two-sided p-value for Conc      0.25
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Concentration is trending up =      0.124  is trending down =      0.876

Should we reject Ho that Flow Normalized Flux Trend = 0 ? Do Not Reject Ho
 best estimate is   -60.16 10^6 kg/year
  Lower and Upper 90% CIs   -327.9     51.4
 also 95% CIs   -394.2    166.4 
 and 50% CIs    -96.7    -16.2
 approximate two-sided p-value for Flux      0.33
 Likelihood that Flow Normalized Flux is trending up = 0.163  is trending down= 0.837

 Upward trend in concentration is unlikely 
 Upward trend in flux is unlikely
 Downward trend in concentration is likely 
 Downward trend in flux is likely
